Scenario C. Bill splitting app

"We are making a budgeting system that allows people to keep track of how much they owe the people in their group. The main target audience is house sharers such as students or parents. It is useful for students as it will allow for easy management of money and will make sure no one is underpaying or overpaying. The motivation for this app came from us all being university students in shared housing and it would be helpful to easily share bills.‚Äù (Team 1C, 2019)
For this scenario, we were instructed to imagine that we were developing the system described in the scenario. We were given an interviewee to act as a potential client and were to ask this client a question regarding user feedback and what they would want from the app.
